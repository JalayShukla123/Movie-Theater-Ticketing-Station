# Movie_Theater_Ticketing_Station
This is a Java program with a set of functions that manage the reservations of seats in an auditorium. It provides functions to display the auditorium, check seat availability, reserve seats, count the number of tickets sold, and display a report of ticket sales. The program uses a 2D character array to represent the auditorium, where each element in the array represents a seat in the auditorium. The main function displays a menu to the user, allowing them to choose from options like reserving seats, checking availability, and displaying a report. Each of the functions in the program takes in parameters that describe the auditorium's layout and the seat information, such as the number of rows, columns, the row, and seat numbers of the seats the user wants to book. The "displayAuditorium" function prints out the current state of the auditorium to the console(which acts as the front-end system), with "." indicating an available seat and "#" indicating a reserved seat. This program can be used as a basis for creating a reservation system for an auditorium or similar venue. Also runs on AWS Cloud9 using an EC2 Instance.
